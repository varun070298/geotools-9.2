This directory contains two JavaScript files; MetaDataCompute.js and gtmpFuncs.js; that need to be installed
on the MongoDB database server as stored JavaScript modules.

Copy both files to your MongoDB server, then install them as follows:
> mongo MetaDataCompute.js
> mongo gtmpFuncs.js
(Assumes "mongo" executable in path. The JavaScript files install the necessary server-side scripts.)
